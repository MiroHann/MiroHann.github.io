# My little Markdown Syntax Webpage
This is my first time trying to build something eligible in Markdown!

I'm building this website using the guide on [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) documents.
```
From my little HTLM experience Markdown seems pretty simple to learn!
Formatting text into something eligble seems to be pretty easy!
```
I'm using visual studio code to preview the output while writing things down!

**Here's a list of some of the things I already Like**

- Simplicity
* Semi Automatic Formating
+ The Documentation

## Implementation of Simple website elements!
I really enjoy the visual nature of the elements you can add to a website! 
```
-[]Something I want done!
-[x]Something I've done!
```
> As seen in this very simple snippet!

- [ ] Something I want done!
- [x] Something I've done!

### A Summary!

**From what I've gathered!**

1. Markdown is meant to be used as a plain text editor for HTML projects! 
1. It is meant to be simple to use ( and it seems to be! )
1. Makes it way easier to read for professionals and non professionals!
1. The consistensy of formatting is kept between devices without interference from the developer!

> [!WARNING]
> The time I've spent with Markdown in limited so my opinions might be off!
